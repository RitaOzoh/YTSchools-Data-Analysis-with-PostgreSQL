# YTSchools-Data-Analysis-with-PostgreSQL
Welcome to the YTSchools Data Analysis project! As a data analyst at YTSchools, I was tasked with setting up their data in a PostgreSQL server and conducting insightful data analysis. YTSchools is an online Edtech platform that specializes in corporate training on popular business intelligence tools.


Project Goals:

1. Set up YTSchools' data in a PostgreSQL database using three CSV files containing information about departments, courses, and students.

2. Analyze the data to provide key performance metrics to YTSchools, including:

-Number of students enrolled in each course.

-Number of students in each department.

-Courses with at least 5 students enrolled.

-Average score of students in the DP1 department.

-Departments without any courses offered.

-Courses offered by the 'Power BI' Department.

3. Import a new table containing teachers' details and perform additional data analysis to answer the following questions:

-Courses without assigned teachers.

-Monthly payment made by each department to teachers.

-Department to which 'Mensah James' belongs.

-Number of female and male teachers in each department.

-Teachers responsible for teaching 'PB101'.

-Number of teachers instructing 'PB101' and their average salary.

This repository contains the SQL scripts used for database setup, data analysis, and the results of the queries. Feel free to explore the code and findings to gain insights into YTSchools' performance and teacher-related information.

Join me in this exciting journey of data exploration and analysis to contribute to YTSchools' success and growth as a leading Edtech provider!
